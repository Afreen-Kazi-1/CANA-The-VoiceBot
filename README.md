# CANA
CANA - Conversational Audio-to-Text Neural Assistant is an emotionally intelligent voice assistant.

We propose a deployable, intelligent voice-to-text conversational assistant that replicates the fluency and emotional sensitivity of a human sales representative. Designed for practical use in sales, accessibility, and support contexts, the system handles noisy, accented, multilingual, and ambiguous voice inputs while generating context-aware, emotionally attuned responses.
